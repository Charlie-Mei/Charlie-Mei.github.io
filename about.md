Hey there - welcome to my page!

I am a data analyst who helps software, financial and apparel merchants understand and optimize their affiliate marketing strategies. Previously, I was a consultant who conducted impact analyses and statistical modeling for a variety of clients (from community and health services, to utilities companies) to inform strategic planning.

I have a passion for driving decision-making processes through the use of data. In my spare time, you can find me improving my chess ranking, or out playing tennis.
